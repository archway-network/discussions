## General Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when creating a new topic or discussion.

### Structure

A good discussion should contain the following elements:

#### Background

Provide a brief overview of the subject to set the stage or to provide the necessary **context**.

Include the **rationale**, a statement or paragraph that highlights the value that can be added, the utility that may be gained, or the problem that could be addressed.

Provide some relevant **examples**, as these serve to communicate clear use cases or instances of potential issues or value addition.

#### Question

Pose a question to solicit a discussion on the desired topic.

For example:

* "Will feature X be useful for other developers?"
* "Will feature X significantly affect performance / security?"
* "Does having X solve Y?"
* "Is it technically feasible to attempt X?"

This is also a great opportunity to **reference** current and ongoing research relevant to the question at hand, or to highlight past, present or upcoming potential solutions.

**Refrain** from attempting to answer the question at this point. Doing so runs the risk of "Begging the Question", leading the discussion and potentially alienating other community members from engaging as the perception may be that the outcome is already assumed...

### Examples

The following discussion and issue exemplify solicitation of open discussion respectively:

* Discussion: [Data Privacy in CosmWasm Smart Contracts](https://github.com/orgs/archway-network/discussions/11)
* Issue [Enhancing Querying and Withdrawals of Rewards](https://github.com/archway-network/archway/issues/434)
